# 2048_GAME

In this 2048 game , 

    we are played on a 4Ã—4 grid.
	we want to use arrow keys to slide numbers around and merge tiles of the same value while totaling up the score..
    When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one with their sum (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8).
    Every move adds a new tile (usually 2 or 4) to the grid.
    The goal is to keep merging numbers until you create a tile with the number 2048.
    The game ends when there are no more possible moves.
